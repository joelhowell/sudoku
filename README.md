# Sudoku Solver
#### Using backtracking

## Solving with a twist
This sudoku solver is written in C and implements the backtracking algoritm (an algorithm that I did not write) with a twist: In addition to the traditional rules of sudoku, a constraint has been applied on the diagonals. Each (major) diagonal must only have one occurence of 1-9. The code is heavily inspired from resources online with a few modifications and personal formatting. 

Originally, I had planned to expand this project into multiple source files with a UI and several other features, however, given that this algorithm is not very efficient, I have decided to delay implementing those features until a later date/future project.
